# Superstore_Retail_Analysis
In a Superstore, the audience is diverse, and a way to segment and target them effectively must be identified, in order to improve the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
This analysis allows the retailer to get the right information across to the right recipient to ensure a rewarding shopping experience for the buyer and a lucrative outcome for the retailer.
The objectives of this project:
- To segment customers into different categories based on RFM scores using Cluster Analysis (k-means and Fuzzy c-means clustering).
- To identify customers who are at risk of churning using an Artificial Neural Network framework.
- To build a hybrid recommendation system to provide personalised recommendations to customers based on their past behaviour and preferences.
